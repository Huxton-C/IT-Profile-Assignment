							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>For my project I would like to create a small chatterbot using discord bots with basic trouble shooting methods for common tech issues that most people face on a day-to-day basis. It will go through the steps of fixing your device and ask questions based on their previous answers as to target their specific problem. The bot will be available for discord servers limited to my computers running hours as the host will be from there. The bot will be able to read prompts sent by the user then initiate the questioning process in which the user’s input will diagnose the problem and give them a fix.</p>
							<h4>Motivation</h4>
							<p>My reason for doing this project is because whenever I have tech issues and search them up it always takes rewording the query a few times and opening multiple tabs from that search to finally get a vague answer that works only on older versions of said device or to just not find a fix after an hour of searching, This program is made to put all those really common problems and their solutions to rest as it will provide a fix to hopefully decrease frustration and troubleshooting time of the users. Also, a lot of people are not as tech conscious and I am tired of being asked to fix basic issues on their devices that are easy to learn and fix yourself so this should also solve that issue. Furthermore, I actively use discord quite a bit and the bots intrigue me how they work so this makes a good excuse to find out.</p>
							<h4>Description</h4>
							<p>My bot will start out by just sitting in servers until people call upon it with its command and syntax. These commands execute the specified program for a specific device and specific issue so for example the command “!start mac wifi”(temp) would make the program start to ask the user questions based on Wi-Fi issues for a mac. The questions will start out quite broad in order to obtain a grasp on the situation at hand, then narrow in on the trouble the user might be experiencing and have more personalised questions. As some questions may relate to others to decrease operating time and clutter, I will try and use the same code as much as possible a reimplement it into the bot’s code. The bot will be semi customizable and feature being able to change prefixes to the bot, what kind of users have access to the bot, what privileges are needed for the bot’s commands and its permissions to enact other changes in the server. All code for the bot will be available publicly to everyone in open source so people wanting to use the bot, outside of its limited running time due to my hardware limitations, so they themselves can host it on their own server and customise it more for themselves. These questions will be used to figure out what the issue is and then use this to show the user exactly how to fix that issue on their specific device. I will produce art and graphics for the bot myself as to not have to ensure no rights are being broken and the property is mine to use. The bot will feature a cancel function that can be used to immediately stop the bot’s function immediately. The way you will answer the questions provided will be by using the emoji reactions on discord. The bot will read what reactions the user has clicked on the bot’s question then use that data to decide what to do next. If a conclusion cannot be reached after a specified number of questions, then the program will notify the user that it cannot help them with their issue before linking them to another resource that would hopefully provide some help to them. The bot will be able to diagnose problems based on a list of device and issues in the programs code, however limited, it will cover most basic areas such as internet troubles, application crashes and start-up errors. Devices such as android 11 devices, apple ios 12 devices and windows 10 computers and laptops. Any other devices will not be covered in the program on initial release as I do not have the resources nor time to do so. The program will systematically go through its own branches depending on the selected device. No 2 code lines for each device will be the same as they will be tailored and orientated around finding a specific solution for that user’s problem.</p>
							<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
							<p>To create this application, I might need to use a discord bot hosting service as my machine might not be powerful enough to do so. This I can outsource to one of many services that are also free such as Glitch or I can just try see if my computer can hold the weight of the bot as it isn’t too complex and will only be running on very few discord servers. I will also need to use the discord developer portal in order to code, produce and test the bot which is also available free online.</p>
							<h4>Skills Required</h4>
							<p>For my project I will need to know how to diagnose and fix common issues with tech devices for the program to even function in its basic form, to find this out I will simply use google and search for common the issues problems sites to find the best fixes for each issue and implement them into the program. I will also need to know how to code discord bots in which there is countless of tutorials online for me to learn how to do that. The language used for the bots is python which I am also currently learning which is quite convenient as no extra language is needed to be leant and my prior skills can apply. </p>
							<h4>Outcome</h4>
							<p>If the project is successful, I will have produced a discord bot that can be used to diagnose and amend common issues people have with computers and other common devices. This bot will be running from my own computer or a hosting service. The bot must be able to find a solution to the issue the user has and then communicate the fix to the user as to solve their tech troubles easily and with a simple questionnaire that is tailored to their specific answers. The impact of this will be minor however as the small scale of the project but I hope to provide a resource to a small userbase that can be efficient and useful for their troubles.</p>
