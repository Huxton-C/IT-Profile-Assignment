							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>For my project I would like to create a small chatterbot using discord bots with basic trouble shooting methods for common tech issues that most people face on a day-to-day basis. It will go through the steps of fixing your device and ask questions based on their previous answers as to target their specific problem. The bot will be available for discord servers limited to my computers running hours as the host will be from there. The bot will be able to read prompts sent by the user then initiate the questioning process in which the user’s input will diagnose the problem and give them a fix.</p>
							<h4>Motivation</h4>
							<p>My reason for doing this project is because whenever I have tech issues and search them up it always takes rewording the query a few times and opening multiple tabs from that search to finally get a vague answer that works only on older versions of said device or to just not find a fix after an hour of searching, This program is made to put all those really common problems and their solutions to rest as it will provide a fix to hopefully decrease frustration and troubleshooting time of the users. Also, a lot of people are not as tech conscious and I am tired of being asked to fix basic issues on their devices that are easy to learn and fix yourself so this should also solve that issue. Furthermore, I actively use discord quite a bit and the bots intrigue me how they work so this makes a good excuse to find out.</p>
							<h4>Description</h4>
							<p></p>
							<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
							<p>To create this application, I might need to use a discord bot hosting service as my machine might not be powerful enough to do so. This I can outsource to one of many services that are also free such as Glitch or I can just try see if my computer can hold the weight of the bot as it isn’t too complex and will only be running on very few discord servers. I will also need to use the discord developer portal in order to code, produce and test the bot which is also available free online.</p>
							<h4>Skills Required</h4>
							<p>For my project I will need to know how to diagnose and fix common issues with tech devices for the program to even function in its basic form, to find this out I will simply use google and search for common the issues problems sites to find the best fixes for each issue and implement them into the program. I will also need to know how to code discord bots in which there is countless of tutorials online for me to learn how to do that. The language used for the bots is python which I am also currently learning which is quite convenient as no extra language is needed to be leant and my prior skills can apply. </p>
							<h4>Outcome</h4>
							<p>If the project is successful, I will have produced a discord bot that can be used to diagnose and amend common issues people have with computers and other common devices. This bot will be running from my own computer or a hosting service. The bot must be able to find a solution to the issue the user has and then communicate the fix to the user as to solve their tech troubles easily and with a simple questionnaire that is tailored to their specific answers. The impact of this will be minor however as the small scale of the project but I hope to provide a resource to a small userbase that can be efficient and useful for their troubles.</p>
