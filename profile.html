									<h2>My Interests in IT</h2>
									<h4>Primary Interests</h4>
									<p>My main interests in IT are predominantly in cyber security, cloud computing and artificial intelligence as I believe those fields will have a very large presence in the coming future, also they are very expansive and can be used in so many applications.</p>
									<h4>Background</h4>
									<p>This interest grew in primary school when I had a class where I took apart computers and leant about all the parts. Then in later years of primary school I learnt how to make small games on scratch leading me to wanting to learn proper coding languages which I did through IT and VCE Software Dev throughout high school. Wherein I did quite well and enjoyed these classes, so I decided to pursue a career in it.</p>
									<h4>Why RMIT and The Future</h4>
									<p>I had heard that RMIT was a great school especially for everything IT related courses, on top of that I think it has a very nice campus and facilities also its location being in the city with plenty of services around makes it a great space.In my studies I hope to learn about multiple fields in IT and really get to know which one I will pursue in either a career or further studies as I delve into each of the main fields offered and classes I take.</p>
